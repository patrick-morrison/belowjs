            <h2>The Timaru</h2>
            <p>Discovered by <strong>Grant Pretorius</strong>, <strong>Chas Brown</strong>, and <strong>Huon Fairbairn</strong> with <strong>Luke Nelson</strong> skippering; in a joint operation between <strong>Maritime Discovery Group</strong> and <strong>WreckSploration</strong> on <strong>28/03/2025</strong>. The wreck lies in <strong>50m of water</strong> off the south west of Rottnest Island.</p>
            
            <p>During <strong>WWI</strong>, the Commonwealth Government requisitioned or purchased a number of dredges from around Australia, and between <strong>1917 and 1919</strong> brought them to WA for dredging Cockburn Sound for the construction of the <strong>Henderson Naval Base</strong>. With the cessation of the war, work stopped and the dredges were laid up in Cockburn Sound, and slowly sold off during the 1920s. One of those was the <strong>steam hopper barge 404</strong>, aka <strong>TIMARU</strong>, aka <strong>Naval Dredger 4</strong>, aka <strong>CND4</strong>, built in <strong>1893</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>A <strong>suction Hopper Dredge</strong> is a self-propelled, seagoing vessel that uses suction pipes to dredge material from the seabed and store it in a hopper. These dredgers are versatile and used for various dredging projects, including maintaining waterways, land reclamation, and coastal protection.</p>
            
            <h3>Identification Notes From Dr Ross Anderson (Curator, Western Australian Museum)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Twin-engine vessel with single stem and counter stern in 44.9m (BP) – 48m (LOA) length range</li>
                <li>Suction pump dredge layout suction with suction pipe mounted on starboard side, not fishing vessel or whale-chaser</li>
                <li>Twin engines have been removed/ salvaged</li>
                <li>Boiler has cut-out boiler plating to salvage copper boiler tubes</li>
                <li>Length of site is too short for only other suction dredges scrapped in Graveyard Governor (53.3) and Premier (51.8m)</li>
                <li>Additionally no sign of any car bodies which does not fit Premier historical info, and Premier reportedly had its boiler removed</li>
                <li>Parmelia is right LOA, but should exhibit a twin stem for the bucket ladder dredge that protruded through the lower bow structure</li>
                <li>Site dimensions of 44.9 (BP) x 9.17m are an almost exact match for Timaru 44.19 (BP) x 9.45m allowing for variation as a result of collapsed structure and manual measurements from 3D model</li>
                <li>Unusual heavy rectangular platform structure near bow is a possible crane base, in the right location when matched with historic images of Timaru</li>
                <li>Site/ vessel layout differs to most steamships with boiler apparently located aft of engine, this would be possible with a single boiler and twin-screw layout</li>
                <li>Site formation – Site 42 is heavily broken up, with boiler standing on end, typical of high energy sites indicating it is shallow enough to be impacted by large swells</li>
                <li><strong>Site is identified as Commonwealth Naval Dredge (CND) 4/ ex Otago Harbour Board dredge Timaru/ Lobnitz & Co yard number 404</strong></li>
            </ul>
